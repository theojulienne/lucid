What is Lucid Toolkit?
======================

Lucid Toolkit is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) platform abstraction library for C and other languages, and is available to be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License version 1.1 at your option. Lucid Toolkit is different to most other graphics toolkits in that it doesn’t try to re-invent the wheel, but rather is a layer above the existing toolkits available (Win32 API, GTK, Cocoa, ...). The result is that applications look and function like the user expects on their respective system.

Lucid aims to provide an array of useful libraries for software developers that, where needed, use the native platform’s functions to provide faster/cleaner results. The Lucid Base library provides a solid base for the other libraries, including an object/event system, re-usable hash table and linked list code, and an extensible main loop based on the object/event system.

It is an aim of Lucid to provide an intuitive, powerful and simple API. Lucid Toolkit also includes a powerful easy to use text-based layout engine, Layout Expression Language .

The simple nature of the Lucid API makes it simple to create language bindings so Lucid can be used in Python, C#, D, Ruby, Lua, etc. Interfaces for these languages are under development, and the interaction with them is considered as the API is being designed.
